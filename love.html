<p class="lora-body">Greetings, my love. How are you? I hope you are doing well. I created this website with my own knowledge so I apologize if it is not that great. I did it with love though... <em>*smirk*</em>. This website is my own work, a love letter to you, <strong>my special one</strong>.</p>
<p class="lora-body">My love, I am really glad to have you in my life. To be able to love you is a privilage <i>I cherish</i>. This website is something i created for you just to show you my love. Even words are not enough to tell you how much <strong>I miss you</strong> right now.</p>
<p class="lora-body">The times I spend with you are really <strong>special</strong>. Just playing games, talking, or you sending those funny stuff to me; Those moments have a special place in my heart</p>
<p class="lora-body">My baby, <strong>take care of yourself</strong> ha? You've been puyat so much lately that it is worrying me... and eat more... I don't want anything bad happening to you.</p>
<p class="lora-body">I usually write more kapag handwritten... so take my letters la.</p>
<p class="lora-body">P.S. I don't have that much experience with coding nor web design so pasensiya na... I will be updating this site though... I'll tell you when.</p>

<p class="lora-body"><strong>I LOVE YOUUUUU MWAMWAMWAHMWAH</strong></p>
