<p class="lora-body">Hi, my baby. How are you? I hope you are doing fine at the current time you are reading this. I would not want anything bad happening to my dearest after all.</p>
<p class="lora-body">Anyways, have you eaten yet, darling? Did you eat much...? Hmm... Have you gotten a full night's sleep? Are you feeling well? Take care of yourself ha?</p>
<p class="lora-body">Mwahahaha did I tell you that you are so pretty, so beautiful, so kind... really. Every compliment that I wrote on that homepage is one that I mean and have seen from you.</p>
<p class="lora-body">I updated this site which will be like a release version...? I guess? The first version you saw was very barebones. I will update this site again though... Won't tell you when this time.</p>
<p class="lora-body">Finally, my love. I really appreciate everything you do for me. Our talks, calls, chats, plays, everything is one that I am very fond of. I would like to experience more things in life with you, beautiful. I love you so much.</p>
<p class="lora-body">P.S. You have to take my gift sometime... Also, I miss <strong>hearing</strong> your I love you</p>

<p class="lora-body"><strong>I LOVE YOUUUUU MWAMWAMWAHMWAH</strong></p>
