<p class="lora-body">My baby, How are you? I hope you are doing fine when you are reading this. I would not want anything bad happening to my dearest after all.</p>
<p class="lora-body">Anyways, have you eaten yet, darling? Did you eat much...? Hmm... Have you gotten a full night's sleep? Are you feeling well? Take care of yourself ha? I always like to check up on you because ramdam ko na hindi mo na inaalagaan ang body mo... Malakas ka na magpuyat ha... I'd like you to be more caring to yourself kasi again, I would not want anything bad happen to my baby.</p>
<p class="lora-body">Mwahahaha did I tell you that you are so pretty, so beautiful, so kind... really. Every compliment that I wrote on that homepage is one that I mean and have seen from you. Kahit hindi mo napapansin, I see those qualities in you, my darling, and I love them. I hope you notice those qualities too.</p>
<p class="lora-body">Finally, my love, I really appreciate everything you do for me. Our talks, calls, chats, plays, everything is one that I am very fond of. I would like to experience more things in life with you, beautiful. I love you so much that words literally aren't quite enough. My honey, you are so much more than what I could ask for. I mean it in a way na I am so glad I could have you in this life. I would've never imagined na I could have someone like you... Being able to love you so much is one of the best feelings and missing you is one of the worst. You truly have impacted my life, one way or another, I wanna thank you for being part of my life, pretty. My sugar, keep being kind. I love you.</p>
<p class="lora-body">P.S. I will update this site again... I hope you liked my update huhuhu... web design is a pain</p>
<p class="lora-body">P.P.S. I miss <strong>hearing</strong> your I love you... flz</p>
